This is our take on a uni project.
It is horrible.
Why is JavaFX like this. Why does SceneBuilder not work? Why did we not use Swing from the start? We will never know.
What does ElasticSearch do? Why is it so used? Why does it use only JSONs? Why?
Why are official documentations not working?
The list goes on...

To test this, you simply have to have MySQL installed with the required database schemas created. They can be found in the DB folder.
Once the schemas are made, you only have to change your login credentials in databaseDAO's constructor.

Then, you can simply witness how we failed to mix the horrible idea of fxml and java classes.
